					<li>Point spread payoff: The point spread is expressed as a 3 digit number. For example, -110 means a player must bet $110 for every $100 they wish to win.  Or +225 means a player will win $225 for every $100 bet.
					</li>
					<li>Parlay payoff – Odds will be calculated based on the prices of the individual selections.</li>
					<li>Teaser payoff – Odds are derived from a fixed payout chart. </li>	
				</ul>

				<p><em>4. Notification of Odds or Line Changes

				<p><em>In-Play Picks</em></p>

				<p><strong>6.1 General</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>If a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but FanTwist Sportsbook fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:</li>
					<li>if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void; and</li>
					<li>if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, FanTwist Sportsbook will use its reasonable efforts to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by FanTwist Sportsbook will be void.</li>
					<li>FanTwist Sportsbook aims to use its reasonable efforts to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, FanTwist Sportsbook does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.</li>
					<li>FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right at its absolute discretion to part-suspend or fully suspend outcomes/selections in a market that has been turned in-play.</li>
					<li>FanTwist Sportsbook customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.</li>
					<li>For the purposes of in-play Picks, customers should be aware that transmissions described as “live” by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data. Please also be aware that, for operational reasons, bet requests made in-play may take slightly longer to process.</li>
					<li>If FanTwist Sportsbook accepts a bet on a market for which the outcome has already been determined, then that bet shall be deemed void (and no winnings shall be payable in respect of it regardless of the bet being a win, lose or push).</li>
					<li>While reasonable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of live scores and the status of games displayed on the Website and the Picks Apps in connection with live Picks, we accept no liability for the incorrect display of this information.</li>
				</ul>


				<p><em>Results and market settlement</em></p>
				<p><strong>7.1 General</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Where the Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result.</li>

					<li>
						If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined by FanTwist  Sportsbook (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then FanTwist Sportsbook shall (acting reasonably) determine either:
						<ol>
							<li>
								whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or
							</li>
							<li>
								whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except where FanTwist Sportsbook has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered by FanTwist Sportsbook (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).

							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of FanTwist Sportsbook. FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to FanTwist Sportsbook’s reasonable satisfaction.

					</li>

					<li>
						In the event of a withdrawal of a selection after the start of an event due to such selection testing positive for a virus or other disease, all wagers on that selection shall be void.
					</li>

					<li>
						All-In Picks - All-In' means that regardless of whether or not a particular competitor or team or member of a team starts or completes the event on which a bet is placed, all bets stand and no refunds will be payable. Clients will be notified if a market is All-In via Blurbs, Market title and/or Selection name. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Weekly/Daily specials: All relevant games must be played to a natural completion for wagers to stand. In the event one or more game(s) are postponed and/or have a venue change, all wagers in the relevant market will be refunded.
					</li>

					<li>
						Regarding player markets. Additional to the rules above, all listed players must be active for wagers to stand. If one or more player(s) listed do not play, all wagers will be refunded. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>7.2 Resettlements</em></p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. FanTwist Sportsbook may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared purely as a customer service benefit. However, FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if:
						<ol>
							<li>
								the official result is different to the result on which FanTwist Sportsbook initially settled the market; or
							</li>
							<li>
								if the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						FanTwist  Sportsbook reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical error).
					</li>

					<li>
						If FanTwist Sportsbook resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance and/or the deduction of funds from a customer’s Account to reflect changes in market settlement.
					</li>

					<li>
						FanTwist Sportsbook will settle markets on the basis that it obtains the relevant information once the outcome has been determined. If this information is not obtained, or if there is an obvious error in the information, the settlement of the bet offer will be based on other public information/ official sources at the reasonable discretion of FanTwist Sportsbook.

					</li>
					<li>
						FanTwist Sportsbook may be required by law to seek approval with the relevant regulatory body before making any amendments to a price or bet status.

					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>7.3 Non Runners</em></p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Unless stated otherwise, sports bets are accepted on a “non-runner, no bet” basis. This means that stakes will be refunded on a player, team or other competitor that is withdrawn prior to the start of an event. If you have placed a bet on a sporting event run on a “non-runner, no bet” basis and a player, team or other competitor (on which you did not place your bet) is withdrawn, suspended or disqualified from that event, we may apply relevant deductions to your winnings (based on the price of the player, team or other competitor that is withdrawn referenced in the table below).
					</li>
					<li>Where specified, certain markets will be offered on an “all-in compete or not” basis. This means that, if a player, team or other competitor is withdrawn from an event (whether he, she or it pulls out of the event, is suspended or disqualified from it or otherwise) before he, she or it has taken part in the event, then any bet placed on that player, team or competitor (as applicable) will be deemed a losing bet.
					</li>
					<li>If an event is specified as “fixed draw” and a team, player or other competitor is withdrawn, suspended or disqualified from that event, we reserve the right to settle any bets on the subsequent prices once the market has been revised without the withdrawn team/player.
					</li>
					<li>If a player, team or other competitor has taken any part in a sporting event once it has officially started and then fails to complete that event for any reason, any bet placed on that player, team or other competitor will be deemed live (i.e. bets on that player, team or other competitor will not be voided).
					</li>

				</ul>

				<p><em>Unexpected events and other changes</em></p>
				<p>To the extent there is any inconsistency between the general rules contained in this Part B, Section 8 and the Specific Sports Rules applying to a specific event, the following general rules will prevail:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>If an event or events occur beyond the reasonable control of the FanTwist Sportsbook such as an epidemic, pandemic, flood, fire, earthquake, element of nature or act of God, act of war, terrorism, riot, rebellion, strike, blockade, labor disruption or other cause, that materially impact any sporting or other event (or a series of events in a season), which is the subject of a contingency or outcome of a market offered by the FanTwist  Sportsbook, the FanTwist Sportsbook may, acting in good faith, exercise its discretion to void, cancel, restrict or otherwise alter or adjust the payout (in whole or in part) of the affected wager(s) placed on the relevant market (including, without limitation, retrospectively take any of the actions contemplated once a bet has been placed and before or after it has been resolved). For the avoidance of doubt, “impact” on any sporting or other event includes, without limitation:</li>
					<li>Any reduction in the number of games or matches in a season;
					</li>
					<li>Any material change in the length of a game or match or when the matches are played;
					</li>
					<li>A material change to the format or rules of the relevant event(s), series or competitions as determined by the relevant sports body; or
					</li>
					<li>A change in the location of any match, game or event.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Futures Settlement
				</em></p>

				<p>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules in relation to how and on what basis a futures market will be settled the following shall apply.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Where a season or tournament is unexpectedly shortened all futures markets/bets will be settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body after the postponement, subject to i. and ii. below, so long as the ruling is made within 90 days after the scheduled completion date:
						<ol>
							<li>unless the outcome has unequivocally been determined prior to the interruption of the season – example Team A were prior to the postponement unable to win more than x regular season games, bets on over x games will be settled as a loser and bets on under x wins settled as winners;
							</li>
							<li>Where the competition format has materially changed after the postponement and any outcome that was prior to the postponement possible is no longer made possible due to the format change – example Team B were mathematically able to make playoffs prior to the postponement however a new playoff format announced after the postponement prevented any opportunity to make playoffs, all bets on Team B to make and miss playoffs will be void.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						Where a league/ governing body officially suspends a season and rules for recording purposes that all stats are final on the shortened season, futures will be settled in accordance with the official ruling. If deemed completed by the relevant governing body, winners will be settled as so, and remaining selections void unless the outcome has unequivocally been determined prior to the suspension of the season or stated by the relevant governing body:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Example: 2019/20 NHL Regular season points: Detroit Red Wings Over/Under 74.5 points settled as Under 74.5 as the winning selection. Result fully determined prior to season suspension ( Detroit Red Wings on 39 points prior to suspension. Only 24 points on offer if season was to resume thus result fully determined as Under 74.5).

							</li>
							<li>
								Example: 2019/20 NHL Regular season points: Boston Bruins Over/Under 100.5 points. Boston Bruins had recorded 100 points prior to season suspension. Result undetermined if season wasn’t to resume and thus voided.
							</li>
							<li>
								Example: 2019/20 Rocket Richard Trophy. Ovechkin/Pastrnak settled as winners and all other selections settled as losers. Both players leading prior to season suspension and ruled as winners and deemed completed as per governing body.

							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						Bets on markets that don’t reach completion before the interruption but have already been unconditionally determined will be settled as such. For example, if a team is mathematically eliminated from playoffs prior to the interruption then bets on them to miss the playoffs are winners whereas bets on them to make the playoffs or win the Championship are losers.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the ruling governing body announces within 90 days of the original scheduled completion date, the rescheduling of a tournament or competition all bets on the original competition will remain active. At the customer’s request, FanTwist  Sportsbook will void bets made on the originally scheduled tournament or competition but only before the start of the rescheduled competition. In the event that no official ruling is made postponing the competition or tournament within 90 days of the original scheduled completion date all bets will be void.

					</li>
					<li>
						Example: Euro 2020 Soccer Tournament has been rescheduled to take place in 2021 all bets prior to the postponing will remain active unless a customer contacts to void the bet prior to the start of the tournament in 2021.
					</li>
					<li>
						Example: There is no announcement from the International Tennis Federation by September 5, 2020 on the rescheduling of the 2020 French Open, all futures bets on the French Open 2020 will be void.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the following shall apply.
					</li>

					<li>In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or similar: If the event is not completed within 48 hours after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.
					</li>
					<li>
						In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not completed within 24 hours following the scheduled completion date of the event, then any markets relating to the event will be settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling is announced in this 90 day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to FanTwist  Sportsbook customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.

					</li>

					<li>
						If there is no further sporting action in any market that does not contain the selection ‘draw’ or ‘tie’, all bets placed after this conclusion of action will be voided (e.g. If the game ends in a draw and the two selections that are named in the market are “Team A” and “Team B” without a “Draw” or “Tie” selection – the bet on either Team A or B will be Voided).
					</li>
					<li>FanTwist Sportsbook will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). However, by way of example, the following shall apply:
					<ol>
						<li>Major League Soccer Cup = tournament;
						</li>
						<li>
							NFL AFC West = tournament;
						</li>
						<li>Ryder Cup outright = tournament;
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Golf tournament outright = tournament;
				</li>
				<li>Tennis Tournament outright = tournament;

					<ol>
						<li>Motor Race (e.g. Indianapolis 500) = match;
						</li>
						<li>NBA Finals = match;
						</li>
						<li>NBA Championship = tournament.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>11. Change of venue</em></p>

				<p>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after a bet is placed, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team (or in the case of international matches, only if the venue changes to a venue in a different country).
					</li>
					<li>For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after a bet is placed, all bets will stand.
					</li>
					<li>If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey match switching from grass to astro-turf) after a bet is placed, all bets will stand.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Periods of time</em></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply.</li>
					<li>If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after a bet is placed but before the start of the event, then all bets will be void.</li>
					<li>Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have occurred on 45 minutes.</li>
					<li>All bets apply to the relevant full ‘regular time’ period including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.</li>
					<li>References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular number of ‘days’ shall mean the end of the day local time after the expiration of the specified number of days. For example, if a rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule that allows the match to be completed within 48 hours after the scheduled completion date (see Paragraph 3 above) would mean that the deadline for completion of that match would be 11:59:59 p.m. on the 4th of December.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>To qualify markets</em></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply.
					</li>
					<li>Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be determined by the competitor or team that progresses, whether or not they take part in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Dead heats</em></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than expected.</li>
					<li>If a “dead-heat” between two selections is declared on any event, half the stake is applied to the selection at full odds and the other half is lost. If more than two “dead-heats” are declared, the stake is proportioned accordingly.
					</li>
					<li>If not otherwise stated as a push settlement, In the event of a tie, where no 'draw' option was offered by FanTwist on such outcome, wagers will be paid at face value of the ticket (total payout figure including the initial stake) divided by the number of competitors tied for that placing. The stake is proportioned according to the number of competitors tied for that placing. 
					</li>
					<li>For example, $100 placed on Tiger Woods @ +200 to finish top 10. If Tiger ties with four other competitors for 10th position your wager will be calculated by dividing your $100 stake five times as per Rules.  Calculation: $20*+200 = $60.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Errors</em></p>

				<ul>
					<li>FanTwist Sportsbook makes every effort to ensure that it does not make any errors when accepting bets. However, if as a result of technical or system problems or human error, a bet is accepted that is at odds (which includes handicap provisions or similar) and/or is on terms that are either:
					</li>
					<li>materially different from those available in the general Picks market at the time the bet was made; or
						</li>
					<li>clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made including, in either case, because the bet was placed after the start of an event, because the market was not displaying or reflecting in-play status, or because of any other reason, then the FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right to either (i) correct any obvious errors by settling winning bets at the ‘correct price,’ as reasonably determined by FanTwist Sportsbook, or (ii) void any bet placed where such errors have occurred.
					</li>
					<li>If FanTwist Sportsbook accepts a bet on a market for which the outcome has already been determined, then that bet shall be deemed void (and no winnings shall be payable in respect of it).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em>Maximum winnings
				</em></p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>For all events listed below, the maximum payout limits apply on a per day basis. If you place a bet that exceeds the applicable limits for a particular event, the relevant maximum payouts will still apply.</li>
					<li></li>
					<li>The maximum payout limits refer to the total returns on your bets, excluding your original stake.
					</li>
					<li>The maximum payout limits apply to any one customer or group of customers acting together, backing the same combination of selections, regardless of whether or not such bets are struck separately, at a range of different prices, on different days and through a number of different accounts. If FanTwist Sportsbook believes that a number of bets have been placed in this way, the total payment of all those bets combined will be limited to one single maximum payout.
					</li>
					<li>The maximum payouts shown below are shown in U.S. Dollars. If bets are placed in another currency, the maximum payout will be converted using the applicable exchange rate on the day of settlement of the bets.
					</li>
					<li>The following maximum payout limits will apply to the events shown (please note, if a multiple/parlay bet has been placed which involves events with different maximum payout limits, the lowest applicable maximum payout limit will apply to the whole of your parlay bet – for example, if you place a parlay bet on English Premier League football matches and on a PGA Tour golf tournament, your winnings will be capped at $500,000 and not $1,000,000)
					</li>
					<li>
						For games in which we offer Same Game Parlay, the maximum payout will be equal to the overall maximum payout of the event involved, outlined in each sport’s subsection below:

			<p>Overall Maximum Daily Payout Limit: Subject to any lower limits that may apply in respect of any particular event (as set out above), the overall maximum daily payout limit to any customer for all winning bets placed on the FanDuel Sportsbook products combined is $1,000,000. If you place winning bets on those products that exceed this daily limit, your winnings will be reduced to $1,000,000 and the remainder of your winnings in excess of $1,000,000 will be forfeited by you.
			</p>

			<h3><em>Parlays</em></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A parlay bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as one or more chosen selections in any individual event market.
				</li>
				<li>FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain multiple bets or to scale back stakes.</li>
				<li>All parlay bets placed are subject to the Sportsbook Rules that apply to each individual sport that relates to any leg of any parlay bet.
				</li>
				<li>If any selection in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void under the Sportsbook Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that individual leg will be void and the parlay bet shall be adjusted accordingly. For example a treble including one void leg will become a double. If that voided leg means that an individual bet within a parlay becomes a single bet, then this single bet will stand.
				</li>
				<li>Parlay bets combining different selections within the same event are not accepted when there are related contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is likely to affect the odds on the outcome of another event). The rejection of related contingency bets may happen automatically at the bet placement stage. However, if such a bet is taken in error, FanTwist Sportsbook may settle the individual bet combinations which include two or more of the related contingency selections, as single bets.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><em>Miscellaneous</em></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain Sportsbook bets, or to scale back the stakes (on a per user or aggregate basis).

				</li>
				<li>All references to time periods in the Sportsbook Rules relate to the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football game, relates to the local kick-off time.</li>
				<li>All information supplied by FanTwist Sportsbook is done so in good faith. However, FanTwist Sportsbook cannot accept liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores, results or general statistics.

				</li>
				<li>Any results or scores of which you may be advised by a FanTwist Sportsbook employee or agent (for example during Picks in-play) are provided for guidance purposes only.

				</li>
				<li>Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that the selection on which they place a bet is their intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the same name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they know which competitor is being referred to in the relevant market and to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.
				</li>

				<li>Please be aware that if you place related or corresponding bets on a combination of FanTwist Sportsbook’s platforms (and/ or the Picks products of other third parties), it is possible for bets on one product to be voided in accordance with FanTwist Sportsbook’s terms and conditions, while bets on another product may stand. You should note that FanTwist Sportsbook will have no liability to you in the event that one or more of your bets on FanTwist Sportsbook’s products are amended or voided in accordance with FanTwist Sportsbook’s terms and conditions, even if your other related bets stand (and even if you have specifically relied on bets you have placed on one product in order to place related bets on another product).</li>
				<li>FanTwist Sportsbook may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend Picks on a market at any time (even if such suspension is earlier than anticipated by the Sportsbook Rules). In the interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets, FanTwist Sportsbook may also void certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety.
				</li>
				<li>FanTwist Sportsbook promotions are available at the discretion of FanTwist Sportsbook and FanTwist  Sportsbook reserves the right to restrict the availability of a promotion to any person at its absolute discretion.</li>
				<li>FanTwist Sportsbook reserves the right, at our discretion, to perform any and all reasonable investigations on customers for the purpose of verifying information about customers such as source of funds, background history, and creditworthiness.  </li>

		<h3>3. Baseball</h3>
		<p><em>3.1 General Rules</em></p>

		<ul>
			<li>These rules apply to Major League Baseball, all levels of Minor League Baseball, NCAA and World Baseball. World Baseball is considered to be any league where the governing body is outside of the United States.</li>
			<li>All settlements are based on the results and statistics provided by the relevant league’s governing body (e.g. Major League Baseball).</li>
			<li>Should a game not start on the day of the officially listed start time, as stated by the relevant governing body, due to a rain delay or other similar events, all bets will be void. The day of the event will be considered the day according to the time zone in which the game was scheduled to be played.</li>
			<li>In the event of a shortened game, results are official after (and, unless otherwise stated, bets shall be settled subject to the completion of) 5 innings of play, or 4.5 innings should the home team be leading at the commencement of the bottom of the 5th innings (the “4.5 Innings Rule”). Should a game be called, if the result is official in accordance with this rule, the winner will be determined by the score after the last full inning completed (unless the home team score to tie, or take the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which circumstances the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is suspended).
			</li>
			<li>Notwithstanding the above, in certain circumstances where we so specify, results will only be official after (and bets shall be settled subject to the completion of) a minimum of 9 innings’ play, or 8.5 innings should the home team be leading at the commencement of the bottom of the 9th innings (the “8.5 Innings Rule”).
			</li>
			<li>For the purposes of live Picks, the 8.5 Innings Rule shall automatically apply unless stated otherwise - e.g. in the section below entitled “Overview of Specific Baseball Markets” (which shall take precedence over this section). However, should a game be shortened due to bad weather or similar, live Picks markets which have been unequivocally determined will stand (irrespective of the 8.5 Innings Rule or whether or not an official league result has been confirmed).</li>
			<li>Extra innings, where applicable, count for settlement purposes.
			</li>
			<li>If a game is suspended and continues to a conclusion the following day (local time), then all bets will stand. In the case of a suspended playoff/post-season games, all bets will stand until the game is completed within 90 days of suspension.</li>
			<li>When wagering on baseball, you may choose to apply one of the following methods to each wager:
			</li>
			<li>Action: All wagers not placed on the scheduled starting pitchers (the “Listed Pitchers”) will be deemed “action” and will stand regardless of subsequent changes to personnel. As odds on baseball are dependent upon Listed Pitchers, settlement of action bets will be subject to change after placement. The revised market odds after the change is implemented will be used for wager settlement. Odds are subject to change should one or both Listed Pitchers not start the game.
			</li>
			<li>One Specified Pitcher: A wager on or against one Listed Pitcher, regardless of the other Listed Pitcher. In the event that the Listed Pitcher does not start, the wager is “No Action” and will be refunded.  The wager will be subject to an odds adjustment should there be a change in the other Listed Pitcher.</li>
			<li>Both Specified Pitchers: A wager in which both Listed Pitchers must start the game. If both actual starting pitchers are not the ones listed on the wagering ticket, the wager will be deemed “No Action” and refunded. 
			</li>
			<li>For settlement purposes, the team listed second in the event name is considered to be the home team (even if the game takes place at a neutral venue). Example: “Team A v Team B” or “Team A At Team B”, Team B is the home team.</li>
			<li>All outright markets include playoffs where applicable.</li>
			<li>Should a mercy rule be applied, for settlement purposes, markets (for both pre-match and live Picks) will be settled according to the result as determined by the application of the mercy rule.</li>
			<li>Listed Pitchers are not relevant to World Baseball markets and bets on such markets will stand regardless of whether any Listed Pitchers do in fact start. Should a game end in a tie, Money Line wagers will be graded as a push with all other markets settled as per the result.
			</li>

			<li>General Boxing Rules:
			</li>
			<li>Results will be based on the official result at ringside with the exception of a technical draw (the rules for which are set out in the “Technical Decision / Draw” section below).
			</li>
			<li>Results are not official for Picks purposes until verified by officials at the fighting venue. If for some reason official verification does not occur at the fighting venue, then (and only then) will reference will be made to www.boxrec.com for settlement purposes. Should an official or unofficial sanctioning body overturn a fight decision based on an appeal, suspension, lawsuit, drug testing result or any other fighter sanction, this will not be recognized for Picks purposes.
			</li>
			<li>Should a contest be postponed, bets will stand if the rescheduled event occurs within 48 hours. Otherwise, all bets in relation to the contest will be void.</li>
			<li>In the event of a 'no contest' being declared, all bets will be made void, with the exception of selections where the outcome has already been unequivocally determined.
			</li>
			<li>Should there be a substitution for one of the boxers, bets on the original contest will be void, except in a tournament based competition where the equivalent of a Tattersalls Rule 4 deduction may apply (see Prize Fighter below)</li>
			<li>Should there be a change in the manner in which a contest is advertised (e.g. a contest changes from a title fight to a non-title fight) bets will stand.
			</li>
			<li>Match Picks markets where no draw selection is offered will be made void if the match ends in a draw.
			</li>
			<li>In fights where the scheduled number of rounds changes, all bets will stand unless the result would be automatically determined by the change in the number of rounds (in which case, such bets will be voided). For example, if a fight gets changed from a 12 to a 10 round fight, bets on rounds 11 and 12 will be void.
			</li>
			<li>All fights timed for December 31st are potential unconfirmed fights, if the fight doesn't take place by this date then all bets will be void.

			<li>Subject to the following rule, should, for any reason, the scheduled number of rounds be changed before the commencement of the contest, all round by round bets will stand.
			</li>
			<li>Notwithstanding the above rule, should, for any reason, the scheduled number of rounds be decreased before the commencement of the contest, all round by round bets on the dropped rounds will be void. Bets on all the remaining rounds will stand.</li>
			<li>Where a contest finishes before the completion of the scheduled number of rounds and, for any reason, the winner is decided by the judges' scorecards (technical decision/technical draw) then all round bets will be deemed losers.</li>
			<li>If the contest goes to the scorecards, then all round bets will be deemed losers.
			</li>
			<li>Where a contest finishes before the scheduled number of rounds due to an accidental injury and the winner is not determined by the judges’ scorecards, all bets will be void.
			</li>
			<li>For “Total Rounds” settlement purposes, 1 minute and 30 seconds will represent half a round. For example, for a bet on “Over 10.5 rounds” to be a winner, the fight must last beyond 1 minute and 30 seconds in round 11. If the number of rounds for a fight is changed after this market has been set then all bets on this market will be void.
			</li>
			<li>For “Will the Fight Go the Distance” (or similarly titled) markets, should the scheduled number of rounds change, this market will be made void. In the event of a technical decision, for settlement purposes, the fight will have been deemed NOT to have gone the distance (i.e. the scheduled number of rounds).</li>
			<li>Method of victory
			</li>


			<li>A knockout (KO) occurs when the boxer does not stand up after a ten count. Technical knockouts (TKO) occur when a boxer is knocked down three times within the same round and the fight is stopped or where the referee steps in to stop the fight when it is decided that a fighter cannot safely continue. If a fighter fails to answer a bell for the next round then this will also be deemed a TKO. For Picks purposes, KO/TKO options also include disqualification and retirement.
			</li>
			<li>Technical Decision/Draw</li>
			<li>If a fight is scheduled for more than four rounds and, after four rounds, an accidental foul occurs which causes an injury (further to which the referee stops the fight), the fight will be deemed to have resulted in a technical decision in favor of the boxer who is ahead on the scorecards at the time the fight is stopped (and all markets on the fight will stand).
			</li>
			<li>If the accidental injury / technical decision occurs during the first 4 rounds, all bets will be made void UNLESS the result of the relevant market has already been unequivocally determined or if the judges’ scorecards are used to determine an official winner at ringside.
			</li>
			<li>If an intentional foul causes an injury and the injury results in the fight being stopped in a later round: (i) the injured boxer will be deemed to have won by technical decision if he is ahead on the scorecards and (ii) the fight will result in a 'technical draw' if the injured boxer is behind or even on the score cards (and, for settlement purposes, the result of the fight will be deemed to be a draw).
			</li>

			<li>For Picks purposes, Picks on rounds or a group of rounds is for a fighter to win by KO, TKO, disqualification or due to the other fighter retiring during that round or group of rounds. In the event of a technical decision before the end of the fight, all round bets will be deemed to be losers.

			</li>
			<li>Outright bets will be settled based on the winning boxer who lifts the trophy. If a substitute is introduced during the tournament, all outright bets will stand and an outright price will be quoted for the new boxer. All outright bets on boxers who withdraw during the tournament due to injury or cuts (having fought on the card) will be deemed to be losing bets.</li>
			<li>Outright bets will be void on any named boxer who does not start the tournament. This rule does not apply to the reserve fighters.
			</li>
			<li>“Either reserve” (or similar) may be listed as a selection for any Prizefighter tournaments. These selections are priced on a compete or not basis and, accordingly, all bets on these selections will stand whether or not a reserve fighter competes.</li>
			<li>The equivalent of a Tattersall’s rule 4 deduction may be applied to any outright bet where a named fighter is withdrawn before the start of the tournament (and an additional contender added).</li>

		<p><strong> 8.1 General</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Tournament bets will only be settled 36 holes have been completed, and an official result has been declared. Should 36 holes not be completed then all bets on that event will be void except markets that have already been decided (i.e. ‘first round 3 balls,’ ‘First Round Leader,’ etc.
			</li>
			<li>Outcomes will be determined in accordance with the official result of the relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).
			</li>
			<li>Dead Heats apply for all golf markets in the event of 2 or more players finishing in the same position, except in the following situations:
				<ol>
					<li>A tie/draw option is offered.</li>
					<li>The position is decided by an official playoff.</li>
					<li>Upon a tie in the Tournament Match Picks market, stakes will be refunded
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Dead heat is a term that describes when two or more selections finish an event tied. If a “dead-heat” between two selections is declared on any event, half the stake is applied to the selection at full odds and the other half is lost. If more than two “dead-heats” are declared, the stake is proportioned accordingly.
			</li>
			<li>For example:</li>
			<li>You bet $100 at odds of +200 and 2 players tie for the same position. 
				<ul>
					<li>Half the stake is lost -$50</li>
					<li>The other half wins and is paid at the same odds. So $50 wins at +200</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If 3 players tie for the same position then: 
				<li>Two thirds of the stake is lost -$66.66 </li>
				<li>The remaining third $33.33 wins at +200</li>
			</li>
			<li>If a player does not start a tournament then all bets on that player will be void.
			</li>
			<li>A player must play 3 holes in a market for bets to stand. If a player withdraws before finishing the 3rd hole, they will be considered as having not played and all bets on the player will be voided.If a tournament is shortened and FanDuel Sportsbook settles the tournament markets then all bets matched after the last completed round will be void.</li>
			<li>If a Tournament/Round is restarted from the beginning, all bets placed after the official off time will be void, except on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which will stand. Bets on 2 or 3 balls will only be void if matched after the tee time of the relevant 2 or 3 ball.</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a postponed event, bets will stand provided the tournament takes place in the same calendar year.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>8.2 Outright Winner</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the event of a play-off the result of the play-off will determine the winner of the tournament.</li>
			<li>When more than one player shares the same lowest score in a tournament and there is no play-off, bets are settled by the normal dead heat method. See Section 12.1 above for dead heat example.</li>
			<li>Any players who withdraw after they have completed 3 holes or more are considered as players and are therefore losers, unless the player takes no more part in the tournament after the bet is placed.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>8.3 2/3 Balls</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Players must complete 3 holes for bets to stand
			</li>
			<li>In 2/3 ball Picks the winner will be the player in the pairing or group with the lowest score over 18 holes.</li>
			<li>Should a player in the 2/3 ball not tee-off all bets in that 2/3 ball are void. However should a player retire during the round after more than 3 holes, he will be deemed to have played.
			</li>
			<li>If a player posts a score but is later disqualified, all bets will be settled on the score that the player initially signs for that round. Signing of the card is deemed as the weigh-in and subsequent disqualification or amendment of result will be ignored for settlement purposes</li>
			<li>Odds for a tie are offered in 2 ball Picks, therefore in the event of a tie bets on both players are losers and bets on the tie are winners. Dead heat rules apply in the event of a tie in 3 ball Picks. See Section 12.1 for dead heat example.
			</li>
			<li>Any tournament that applies the stableford scoring system, the highest point scorer during the round will be deemed the winner.
			</li>
			<li>Should all players fail to complete the round then all bets will be void.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>8.4 End of Round Leader</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>If 2 or more players tie for the lead after the round, dead heat rules will apply. See Section 12.1 above for dead heat example.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>8.5 Top X Finish (Top 5/10/20 etc.)</strong></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Dead heat rules apply for settlement of all Top X markets:</li>
		<li>For example:</li>
		<li>You bet $100 at odds of +150 for a player to finish in the Top 20, and 5 players finish in a tie for 19th
			<ol>
				<li>Two fifths of the bet has won (19th & 20th) and three fifths have lost (21st, 22nd and 23rd)</li>
				<li>Thus three fifths of the stake is lost (-$60)</li>
				<li>Two fifths of the stake win and is paid at the same odds, thus $40 wins at +150.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong> Player Picks (e.g. Top US Player, Top European Player) & Tournament Group Picks</strong>
		</li>
		<li>In Top Player Picks & Tournament Group Picks, the winner will be the player with the highest placing at the end of the tournament.
		</li>
		<li>If all listed players in a given market miss the cut, the player with the lowest score at the cut will be deemed the winner.
		</li>
		<li>In the event of a tie, dead heat rules apply. (See Section 12.1 for dead heat example)	</li>
		<li><strong>Tournament Match Picks</strong></li>
		<li>In Tournament match Picks the winner will be the player with the highest placing at the end of the tournament
		</li>
		<li>If both players miss the cut, then the one with the lowest score will be deemed the winner
		</li>
		<li>If a player withdraws or is disqualified after making the cut, when his opponent has already missed the cut, the disqualified or withdrawn player is deemed the winner.
		</li>
		<li>If a player withdraws or is disqualified before the cut is made the other player is deemed the winner.
		</li>
		<li>In the event of a tie in tournament match Picks, stakes are refunded
		</li>
		
		<li><strong>Matchplay Markets</strong></li>
		<li>For all matchplay markets (e.g. individual matches in the WGC Match Play or Ryder Cup) if, after 18 holes, the match is tied then:
		</li>
		<li>if the tournament allows for sudden death or playoff hole(s), then the market will be settled on the result of the sudden death or playoff hole(s); or
		</li>
		<li>if the tournament allows for halved matches, then the market will be settled as a “half”; or
		</li>
		<li>If the tournament allows for halved matches, and there is no half/tie/draw option offered, then stakes on the match Picks will be refunded.</li>
	
	</ul>

	<p>For team matchplay events, bets on the winner of any singles match will be void if that match does not reach its natural conclusion. A match will be deemed not to have reached its natural conclusion if, for example, the applicable players agree to a half because the overall team contest has already been determined.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>8.6 Strokeplay hole-by-hole markets (i.e. performance of a named player on a given hole)
		</strong></li>
		<li>Should a hole not be completed for any reason all bets on that hole will be void unless the market has been unconditionally determined.
		</li>
		<li>Markets are settled on completion of the hole and any subsequent penalties or disqualification will not be taken into account.</li>
		<li><strong>8.7 Matchplay hole-by-hole markets (i.e. performance of players against each other on a given hole)
		</strong></li>
		<li>Any player or team withdrawing or being disqualified having played a stroke on that hole will be settled as a loser providing at least one other player completes that hole.</li>
		<li>If any player or team does not play a stroke on a hole all bets will be void.</li>
		<li>Markets are settled on completion of the hole and any subsequent penalties or disqualification will not be taken into account.</li>

	</li>
	<li>In any case where there is no podium presentation, but the market states that settlement of the relevant market will be based on the result at the time of the podium presentation, then the market will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).</li>
	<li>For Formula 1 “first retirement markets” the following rules shall apply. All bets placed on drivers who do not start the formation lap will be deemed void.

	</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>11. Soccer</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Unless otherwise stated, all bets on soccer markets apply to 90 minutes of play according to the match officials, plus any added injury or stoppage time. However extra-time and penalty shoot-outs are not included. The only exceptions are for: matches that are scheduled for a lesser duration (e.g. 60, 70,80 or 120 minutes) as agreed by the laws of the competition in which they are competing or agreed by both sides prior to kick-off. In such cases, if the match is played in the traditional format of two halves, all bets will be settled at the end of the agreed game length which includes time added on by the referee for stoppages (whether the game length is advertised by FanTwist Sportsbook or not). If the game is played in an unusual format (e.g. 3 or 4 periods) then all half-time markets will be voided but all other markets will be settled on the basis of the score at the end of the match (including any time added on by the referee for stoppages).
	</li>
	<li>In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, FanTwist Sportsbook aims to use its reasonable efforts to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below). However, FanTwist Sportsbook does not guarantee that markets will be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
	</li>
	<li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but FanTwist Sportsbook fails to suspend the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will be void UNLESS it can be established that the bet was actually placed before the actual time of kick-off.
	</li>
	<li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but FanTwist Sportsbook fails to suspend the market at kick-off, but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will stand. HOWEVER the price may be adjusted by FanTwist Sportsbook and the bets may be settled in accordance with the correct price at the time on which the relevant bet was placed (such price to be determined by FanTwist Sportsbook, acting reasonably).
	</li>
	<li>For the purpose of this rule, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded, VAR being reviewed or a player being sent off.
	</li>
	<li>For ‘Extra-Time’ markets, bets apply to 30 minutes of play according to the match officials, plus any added injury or stoppage time. However extra-time and penalty shoot-outs are not included. In ‘Extra-Time’ markets, bets apply to the result during the extra-time period only. For the purposes of this market the score shall be deemed to be 0-0 at the start of the extra-time period.</li>
	<li>In circumstances where over 90% of the scheduled match time has been completed and the referee ends the match before the allotted time has elapsed then we will use that result for the settlement of all bets placed on the game. Otherwise, if a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and FanTwist Sportsbook believes that the match will not have been completed by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all markets, with the exception of any unconditionally determined markets, will be void unless FanTwist  Sportsbook has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its original start date. If FanTwist Sportsbook does have knowledge that the game will be played within three days and the game is played within three days, then all bets will stand except if the match is restarted from the beginning. If the match is restarted from the beginning then all bets matched before the market went in-play will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be void, except for any bets placed in-play on markets which have been unconditionally determined, which will stand.
	</li>
	<li>If a match has not started (or if FanTwist Sportsbook believes that a match will not have started) by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all bets will be void unless FanTwist Sportsbook has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its original start date.</li>
	<li>In the case of ambiguity over the official result from match officials, the outcome will be determined by FanTwist Sportsbook (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources.
	</li>
	<li>If an official fixture lists different team details to those listed on the FanTwist Sportsbook website (for example, the team name, reserves, age group, gender, etc), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be void. In all other cases, bets will stand (including instances where a team name is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in the name).
	</li>

	<li>To the extent that a video assistant referee is consulted, the event which led to the referral will, for the purposes of these rules, be deemed to have occurred at the actual time of its occurrence (rather than the time on which the relevant referral, or decision, was made).
	</li>
	<li>Where we have settled a bet and, due to a subsequent VAR decision, it becomes apparent that such settlement was inaccurate, we reserve the right to reverse such settlement (provided that the VAR decision occurred prior to the conclusion of the match or other timeframe relating to the bet).
	</li>
	<li>Bets which are placed between the occurrence of an incident which leads to a VAR review and the related VAR decision will be deemed void unless: (i) the VAR review (and subsequent decision) did not ultimately alter the decision made by the on-field officials or (ii) the VAR review (and subsequent decision) altered the decision made by the on-field officials but did not have any material influence on the bet(s) in question. All bets which were not materially influenced by the VAR review (and subsequent decision) will stand.
	</li>
	<li>In order to eliminate any doubt, we will consider the VAR as having been used if this is understood from the referee's gestures (e.g. hand gestures or stopping the match to review the incident themselves) and/or VAR usage is confirmed by the match report issued by the official governing body who is ultimately responsible for oversight of the applicable match. In cases where it is unclear whether the VAR has been used due to missing TV coverage and/or conflicting reports, PPBF will settle the bets based on the information acquired from feed providers and generally reputable online sources (acting reasonably).
	</li>
	<li>There is a small possibility that we will inadvertently offer soccer bets in respect of which it is impossible for the outcome to occur (for example, we continue to offer bets on a player to be the first goal scorer in a match after that player has been substituted). While we have implemented systems which aim to prevent this from occurring, in the small number of circumstances where it does, we will void the bets in question (and return the relevant stakes to customers accordingly).
	</li>

	<li>If a team is disqualified, thrown out or otherwise removed from a league before the relevant season has started then all bets involving that team will be made void.
	</li>
	<li>For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets), the first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of stoppage time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 - 10 Minutes" selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match. In other words, it runs from 0:00 until just before the clock hits 10:00. The "11 – 20 Minutes" selection runs from 10:00 until just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each of the other selections in this market.</li>
	<li>For FIFA Man of the Match markets, the market will be settled based on the official ‘Man of the Match’ as determined by FIFA. If FIFA fail to declare an official Man of the Match for any reason, all bets will be void.
	</li>
	<li>For domestic games live on Sky Sports the market will be settled based on who Sky give the award to during their live broadcast. If no award is made during the live broadcast the result will be settled as the player who is listed as the man of the match in the match report on skysports.com. If the result on skysports.com is different from the result of the Sky live broadcast then the markets will be settled on the result from the live broadcast. For live domestic games on BT Sports, BBC and ITV Man of the match bets will also be settled in accordance to who the broadcaster names during the program. In the case of games on these channels, if no player is named during the program then all bets will be voided. The player must be specifically named as the man of the match and not just simply referred to as the man of the match by one of the pundits.
	</li>
	<li>For matches that are broadcast live on Sky Sports as well as another channel, preference for settlement will be given to Sky Sports unless FanDuel Sportsbook have specifically outlined in the naming of the market that the result will be settled on the official tournament or sponsor award.</li>
	<li>Likewise an official tournament or sponsor award outlined in the naming of the market take precedence over the BT, BBC, and ITV pundit’s award.
	</li>
	<li>Any player who takes the field for any part of a match will be deemed as a runner for settlement purposes. Only players not in the squad or unused substitutes will be deemed non-runners.
	</li>
	<li>Anytime Score markets, If one or more of the players do not participate in the game, then they will be deemed non-runners and the original price will be reduced by the price of the said player(s), and settled according to the performance of the remaining selection(s). Players will be deemed a participant in the listed market should they enter the game at any point in 90 minutes play plus injury time
	</li>
	<li>For First/Last Goalscorer markets:
	</li>
	<li>All bets placed on players that do not take part in the match will be void. Bets placed on players who take the pitch after the first goal is scored will be voided for First Goalscorer purposes. Players will be deemed a participant for Last Goalscorer and Anytime Scorer markets should they enter the game at any point in 90 minutes play plus injury time.</li>

	<li>Own goals do not count and will be ignored for settlement purposes. Effort will be made to quote all participants but that will not discount a player that is not quoted from being settled a winner. Bets will only apply to 90 minutes play plus injury time.</li>
</ul>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p><strong>What is Fantwist?</strong></p>
			<p class="mb-2">It really is Fantasy Sports with a Sports Picks Twist.  We use fantasy points scoring to determine game(s) outcomes which are not tied to the game’s final score but the amount of fantasy points scored by players on the same team.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Is It Sports Picks or a Contest?</strong></p>
			<p class="mb-2">It mirrors sports Picks more than a contest.  You can bet on the point spread, money line, totals, parlays and teasers, much like a traditional sports book.</p>
			
			<p><strong>So how do I draft my team and stay within a salary cap?</strong></p>
			<p class="mb-2">You don’t draft a team, nor do you stay within a salary cap, nor do you pay an entrance fee, nor are your chances of winning the bet eliminated because of the injury to a star player, nor can the sharks influence your winning or losing.  If you make a bet on the Philadelphia 76ers to beat the LA Lakers, every player on the 76ers team that plays the Guard, Center, and Forward positions throughout the game will accumulate fantasy points.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Who am I playing against?</strong></p>
			<p class="mb-2">No one.  You are making a bet not playing against anyone.  If you make a Moneyline bet, you are simply Picks that the team you choose and all players on that team playing in the game will score more fantasy points than the opposing team they are playing.</p>
